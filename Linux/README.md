## Automated Data Processing Pipeline – DEC Launchpad Linux Task
This repository contains my solution for the DEC Launchpad Linux task, which involves setting up an automated data processing pipeline.
The project demonstrates concepts such as file manipulation, automation, permissions management, scheduling with cron, and logging in a Linux environment.

## Getting Started
### 1. Set up the Environment

For this project, I used a Linux Virtual Machine (VM), but all commands are also executable in a local environment (e.g., Git Bash, WSL, etc).

### 2. Create the Project Directories

To ensure an organized file system, the following directory structure is created in the home directory:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/data_pipeline/{input,output,logs}
```

- ~ – home directory
- data_pipeline/ – parent directory
- input/, output/, logs/ – subdirectories
